# Scala Community Extension Libraries

This is the _experimental_ home of the Scala Community Extension Libraries.   These libraries are meant to cover gaps, or repair holes, in the Scala standard library.   These libraries are guaranteed to build together, support all recent revisions of Scala and work against nightly Scala.

## Included Libraries

TBD

## Building

The build requires [SBT](http://github.com/harrah/xsbt) version 0.10 or higher.
